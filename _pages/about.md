Hi! This is Abhishek. 

I am a **Visiting Lecturer** in the Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. 

I am also a **Ph.D. Candidate and Bilsland Dissertation Fellow** in the School of Industrial Engineering at Purdue University. 

My research focuses on developing efficient machine learning algorithms for influence maximization and disease-outbreak prevention on social networks (IEEE TETCI, ACM TDS), combinatorial multi-armed bandits for online subset selection (AAAI, ALT, UAI), causal artificial intelligence for randomized experiments (CLeaR), efficient and intelligent transportation* (IEEE T-ITS, ICAPS), and statistical power analysis (IMPS).

I received an MS in Economics from Purdue University and an MSc in Statistics from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur.
